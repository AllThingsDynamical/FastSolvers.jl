# [FastSolvers.jl] (@id index)

[FastSolvers.jl](https://github.com/SciML/FastSolvers.jl) is a Julia package for discretizing symbolically defined PDEs. It complements [MethodOfLines.jl](https://github.com/SciML/FastSolvers.jl) by providing additional collocation based discretization schemes based on RKHS kernels, wavelets, gamblets and random-feature neural networks.
